:octocat: &nbsp;**Live Demo (Chrome only)**: http://web.mit.edu/toksfifo/Public/capture.html

**Video Demo**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPNQgAA5NI8

**Process**: http://web.mit.edu/toksfifo/www/capture.html

**Note**: This project was created as an exercise in User Interface Design and Implementation. No back-end has been implemented.

The wedding’s bride and groom are inherently busy, so they rely on the photographer to capture the wedding experience. However, the photographer can only be in one place at a time, and therefore can’t capture everything that is going on at the event. Moreover, the photographer isn’t available for the events leading up to the wedding such as the engagement party, dress fitting, and bachelor’s party; so many of those experiences aren’t documented properly. There is no central location for the wedding attendees to view all the photos through the whole process (not just the reception) and the interface for reliving the whole experience is suboptimal for the newly wedded couple.
